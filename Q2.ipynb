    "**EXTRA CREDIT (10pts)**: Leverage the sparsity in the constraint Jacobian. You'll need to do a little digging into the interface expected by Julia's optimization solver wrapper, MathOptInterface. To get started, refer to [this section](https://jump.dev/MathOptInterface.jl/dev/reference/nonlinear/#Functions) in the documention. Basically, you'll deal directly with the vector of non-zero entries, rather than a sparse matrix, and specify the row and column of these entries a-priori. Feel free to use the `row` and `col` fields in `HybridNLP` provided for this purpose."
